With 2015 on its first leg and reading other peoples year in review lists and goal lists, I have decided to look at my 2014 and plan for 2015. In 2014 I worked for a Rails company and was able to come up with a few small apps that I use on a daily basis. These apps are not ready to be released, and probably never will be as they are just my attempt at a free version of a paid app that I use. I learned a lot of Rails in 2014 and learned a lot about myself. I learned that I don’t really care what programming language that I am in, I just want to code. Whether its Rails, Ruby, HTML, CSS, JS, or even Go, I just want to program. I have also done some deep soul searching and taught myself that other people’s opinions of me don’t matter. I grew very tired of trying everyday to make the people around me happy, when I realized that all that really matters is that I am happy in the end. That is a bit of a twisted bit, being that making people like my family happy makes me happy. So, in a weird twisted bit of logic making my family happy does matter. I am doubting myself now, so now onto 2015. LOL.

In 2015, I started a new job that I have been dreaming of. A fully remote job that pays me pretty close to the salary that I have always wanted (We will get to the salary I want in the next year, just have to prove myself worthy first). I am not writing in my current favorite language Ruby at the moment, but I am programming code that is making an immediate impact that I love seeing the results of so quickly. So, without further ado, here are some goals I am making publicly:

## Tech Goals

<ul class="default">
  <li>
    Release a public WordPress theme that may or may not be free.
  </li>
  <li>
    Contribute to open source at least once this year (looking at you <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io" target="_blank">Neat</a>)! I have been putting this off as I feel illequipped to contribute, however I think the contribution I have planned should be pretty simple.
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to some kind of local user group at least three times this year.
  </li>
  <li>
    Complete both the Ruby and Javascript paths on <a href="http://codeschool.com" target="_blank">Code School</a>. I bought myself a Codechristmas subscription for 6 months, so this one has to be done soon!
  </li>
  <li>
    Give a lightening talk on why I love to use Vim and tmux.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stretch goal – release my own personal ruby gem. Not sure of what it will do yet, but release something that will solve one of my own personal problems.
  </li>
</ul>

## Home Goals

<ul class="default">
  <li>
    Spend at least 30 minutes playing with my daughter, Abbie.
  </li>
  <li>
    Facetime my daughter Micaiah at least once every two weeks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spend a romantic hour (non-sexual) alone and detached with my wife once a week.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow my wife to break away for an hour for alone, non-work related, time once a week.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clean one room a week in the house.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cook dinner for my family once a month.
  </li>
</ul>

## Personal Goals

<ul class="default">
  <li>
    Get my damn Associates Degree. I am enrolled to start taking classes for my Graphic Design Degree, which may possibly take longer then this year but I want to push myself.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do more woodworking. <ul class="default">
      <li>
        Build a bed frame.
      </li>
      <li>
        Build a turtle tank stand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Build a detached shed to be used as an office.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Read more. Not just tech books, but things that I enjoy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spend at least one hour a week alone doing whatever I want.
  </li>
  <li>
    Figure out what I am spiritually. Spend time dealing with my emotional problems and decide once in for all if I live a Christian live or if I will not.
  </li>
  <li>
    Run a public 5k event.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get down to a weight between 175 and 185 lbs.
  </li>
</ul>

I know these seem like a lot of goals for most of you, but they are things that I spent the last half of 2014 trying to accomplish. In 2015 I am going to accomplish as many of these as possible and will post my progress as I go as well as a recap in 2016. I am putting these here so that people can keep me accountable, there is no one better to keep me accountable then the hundreds of you reading this!

With that, good madams and sirs, I am going to go enjoy 2015!

**UPDATE:** I created a <a href="https://trello.com/b/NMzvF2rD/2015-goals" title="2015 Goals Trello Board" target="_blank">Trello board</a> to track my progress of some of the goals. The things that are goals that happen every week or every month are not on here, but I will still try and do those as much as possible.
